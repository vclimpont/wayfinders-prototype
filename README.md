# Wayfinders prototype

This project is a small prototype made with Unity in order to test core features of a game concept. 
The concept is a 3D third person puzzle game in which the player has to solve puzzles by using a lantern with multiple lights functionnalities.

The lantern is the main feature of the game. It can be switched on and off by the player. Its intensity fades over time so it has to be frequently reloaded by staying nearby campfires. The player can also use multiple lantern's mechanics based on the current light color to interact with the environment and solve puzzles.

4 types of colors are prototyped in this project :
* **Orange color** : this is the default color. It lights up the place but has no particular interaction with the environment
* **Red color** : the player casts a red ray from the lantern that bounces on mirrors surfaces.
* **Green color** : the player uses the lantern to charge or destroy specific objects with a green thunderbolt.
* **Purple color** : the player casts a purple light area that may reveal secrets in the environment
